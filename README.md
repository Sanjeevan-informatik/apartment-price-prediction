# apartment-price-prediction

In this data science project, we design a website which predicates real estate price.

Requirement for this project:
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. google colab notebook, sublime text edioter  and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI



step by step process:
1. Data Load: Load  home prices into a dataframe
2. Drop features that are not required to build our model
3. Data Cleaning: Handle NA values
4. Add new feature(integer) for exiting unstructured feature
5. Apply dimensionality reduction technique here to reduce number of locations
6. Outlier Removal Using Business Logic
7. Outlier Removal Using Standard Deviation and Mean
8. visualize the data point  after remove the outlier using Plot same scatter chart
9. build a model using sklearn and linear regression where we used GridSearchCV  to Find best model 
10. build  a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests
11. build   awebsite built by html, css and javascript that allows user to enter the input
